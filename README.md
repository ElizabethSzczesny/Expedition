# THE EXPEDITION An Interactive Story for Children
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

This project was created to be an interactive, engaging reading experience for young learners. Effectively creating the experience of having a book being read to them, with additional learning reinforcement.

Relying on vivid visuals and highlighted vocabulary words, those words can then be moved into place over the correct item on the visual depiction. Upon matching the word to the correct place on the image the word is pronounced over the speaker. In addition, the page 'turns.'

To begin this project I first sourced the imagery I was going to use from the 'Heritage Library.' This is an online database of open source visuals that can be used in digital projects. After being inspired as to which story I wanted to tell, I wrote the simple story.

Next, began the coding.
